# Beyond the Hype

The AI hype cycle is in full swing. Every company claims to be "AI-powered," every pitch deck mentions machine learning, and every conference has panels on artificial intelligence.

But for African enterprises, the question remains: what's real and what's hype?

## The Real Opportunities

### Process Automation
The unglamorous truth is that most enterprise AI value comes from automating routine processes. Document processing, customer service, and data entry are being transformed.

### Predictive Analytics
African businesses sit on mountains of underutilized data. AI can turn this data into actionable insights for supply chain optimization, demand forecasting, and risk assessment.

### Language AI
With 2,000+ languages spoken across Africa, AI-powered translation and localization represents a massive opportunity.

## The Challenges

Let's be honest about the challenges:
- **Data quality**: AI is only as good as the data it's trained on
- **Infrastructure**: Many AI applications require connectivity and compute that isn't universally available
- **Talent**: The AI skills gap is real

## Our Advice

Start with clear business problems, not technologies. The most successful AI implementations we've seen focus on specific, measurable outcomes—not on deploying the latest models.
